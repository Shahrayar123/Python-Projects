## Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too big, too small, or correct.
4. Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.

## Game Logic

- The game starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100.
- After each guess, the player receives feedback on the guess (too big, too small, or correct).
- The game keeps track of the number of attempts until the correct number is guessed.

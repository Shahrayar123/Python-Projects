## A Number Guessing Game


A simple python program that uses random number generator to generate a number between 1 to 100 and match it with the user input. It keeps on prompting the user with hints (whether the number is too small or large) until he/she gets it right. It also keeps track of the number of attempts the user has made to get the right answer. The game can be replayed as many number of times as the user wants.

### How to Play
1. Run the game.
2. The game will generate a random magic number between 1 and 100.
3. You have to guess the magic number by inputting your guess.
4. The game will provide hints ('Too big' or 'Too small') based on your guess.
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the magic number.
6. Once you guess the number correctly, the game will display the number of attempts it took you to win.
7. You can choose to keep playing or quit the game.

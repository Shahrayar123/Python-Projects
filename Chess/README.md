# Chess

## Overview
This is a Python-based Chess game that allows two players to compete against each other or one player to face a bot on the same machine. The game includes the full set of chess rules, such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. Currently, there are two bot difficulty levels: `Easy` and `Medium`, both explained in the script. A `Hard` mode is also available but commented out as its logic hasn't been implemented yet. Feel free to challenge yourself by completing it!

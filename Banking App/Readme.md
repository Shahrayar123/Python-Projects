# Banking System

This is a simple banking system implemented in Python that allows users to create accounts, log in, check their balance, add income, transfer money to other accounts, and close their accounts.

## Features

- Create a new account with a randomly generated card number and PIN
- Log in to an existing account
- Check the current balance
- Add income to the account
- Transfer money to another account
- Close the account

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (included in Python's standard library)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `card.py` file:

```
python card.py
```

4. The program will display a menu with the following options:

```
1. Create an account
2. Log into account
0. Exit
```

5. Follow the prompts to create a new account or log in to an existing account.
6. Once logged in, you can perform various operations like checking your balance, adding income, transferring money, or closing your account.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are:

- `Card` class: This class handles all the operations related to creating accounts, logging in, and performing various actions on the account.
- `sqlite3` module: This module is used to interact with the SQLite database, which stores the account information.
- `random` module: This module is used to generate random card numbers and PINs.

The `Card` class has the following methods:

- `create_account()`: Creates a new account with a randomly generated card number and PIN, and stores the information in the database.
- `log_in()`: Prompts the user for a card number and PIN, and checks if they are valid. If valid, it allows the user to perform various operations on the account.
- `success()`: This method is called after a successful login and displays a menu of options for the user to choose from.
- `luhn_2(num)`: Checks if a given card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.
- `luhn()`: Generates a valid card number according to the Luhn algorithm.
- `menu()`: Displays the main menu and handles user input.

## Database

The application uses an SQLite database named `card.s3db` to store account information. The database has a single table named `card` with the following columns:

- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY): A unique identifier for each account.
- `number` (TEXT): The card number.
- `pin` (TEXT): The PIN for the account.
- `balance` (INTEGER): The current balance of the account (default is 0).

## Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn algorithm is used to validate and generate card numbers. It is a widely used algorithm for checking the validity of credit card numbers. The implementation of the Luhn algorithm is provided in the `luhn_2(num)` and `luhn()` methods of the `Card` class.

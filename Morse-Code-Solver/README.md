# Morse Code Solver
A simple recursive function that iterates through
all possible versions of a morse code string.
## How To Use

There are two arguments, "solvedcharacters" 
and "remainingcharacters". For the best outcome, it
is recommended you start with some solved characters since
there are many possibilities. Otherwise, input a blank string
for "solvedcharacters" and your string of dots and dashes for
"remainingcharacters" and watch the terminal as all possible 
outputs are printed.

# Next tasks:
# 1- is to make this program in such a way that if word not exist then do something
# 2- also if user enter wrong word by mistake (for example if user want to enter ""happy"" but type "Haappyy") then do something
# 3- task number 2 is with get_close_matches() for difflib library
# 4- then make GUI application of this

This simple yet engaging game allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an intelligent AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves, providing a challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or less installed on your computer.
2. Install Pygame by running the following command:
```python
   pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

To start the game, simply run `runner.py`. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to play as X or O. The AI will then make its moves based on the minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Play against an intelligent AI opponent.
- Choose to play as either X or O.
- Uses the minimax algorithm for strategic gameplay.

And, since Tic-Tac-Toe is a tie given optimal play by both sides, you should never be able to beat the AI (though if you donâ€™t play optimally as well, it may beat you!)

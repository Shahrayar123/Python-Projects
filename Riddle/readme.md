# Random Riddle Game

This is a Python program that presents a series of riddles to the user in a random order. The program uses a dictionary to store the riddles and their corresponding answers, and the `random` module to present the questions in a random order.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can run the program by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where you saved the `random_riddle_game.py` file, and typing:


## Usage

When you run the program, it will present a series of riddles to the user. The user must enter their answer for each riddle, and the program will tell them whether their answer was correct or not. At the end of the game, the user's score will be displayed.

You can customize the program by adding more riddles to the `riddles` dictionary in the code. Each riddle should be a key in the dictionary, with the corresponding answer as the value.

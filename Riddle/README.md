# Riddle Generator
The Riddle Generator is a Python program that generates random riddles for the user to solve. The program uses the `random` module to choose a riddle from a list of pre-defined riddles, and prompts the user for an answer. If the user's answer is correct, the program congratulates them and adds a point to their score. If the user's answer is incorrect, the program tells them the correct answer and does not add a point to their score.

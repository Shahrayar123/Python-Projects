# Logging Framework
Logging or printing is the easisest way to debug or analyse the code flow.
I have used the basic logging facility provided by python.

## Project Hirerachy
- common folder to have all the common utilities.
- tests folder test the common utilities.
- Currently I have added file handlers to write the logs into.

## Run configurations.
- Try to set PYTHONPATH to root folder(LoggingFramework) before running the tests.

## Enhancements
We can enhance even more in regards with this by adding handlers
- Console Handlers
- File Handlers
- Color Formatters.

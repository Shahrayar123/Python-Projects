pip install beautifulsoup4

3. Open the `web_scraping.py` file and modify the `url` variable to specify the website you want to scrape.

The program will send a GET request to the specified URL, parse the HTML content, and extract the webpage title and paragraphs. The extracted data will be displayed in the console.

How to Play
Player 1 (X) starts by choosing a position on the grid numbered 1 to 9.
Player 2 (O) takes the next turn by choosing an empty position.
The game continues until a player wins by placing three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or the game results in a tie.
Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns choosing a spot (1-9) to place their mark (X or O).
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all 9 spaces are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

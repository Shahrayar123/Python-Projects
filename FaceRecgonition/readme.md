## Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV and dlib


## Introduction

This Python script captures video from your webcam and detects faces in real-time using the OpenCV library and the dlib face detection model.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- dlib

You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install opencv-python
pip install dlib


## Usage
- Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
- Ensure that your webcam is connected and accessible.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
- Run the script using the following command:

python face_detection.py

The script will open your webcam and start detecting faces in real-time. Detected faces will be highlighted with rectangles, and a number will be displayed on each detected face to indicate its order.

## Exiting the Application

To exit the application, simply press the 'q' key on your keyboard while the window displaying the webcam feed is in focus.
